# generator-angularfire-fab

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

"A generator is basically a plugin that can be run with the `yo` command to scaffold complete projects or useful parts."

Visit the site.

```bash
http://yeoman.io
```

Install yeoman with npm.

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### AngularJS + Firebase = <3

I tried using the official angularfire yeoman generator. I felt it installed too much content for a simple app. I decided to do one myself.
This generator installs basic modules to work with angularfire, and a simple setup using angular ui-router.
From this point you can modify it to suit your needs and deploy your apps and websites much faster and maybe lighter and in more complex ways.

To install generator-angularfire-fab from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-angularfire-fab
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo angularfire-fab
```
